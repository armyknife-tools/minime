# Contributing to OpenTF

This repository contains OpenTF Core, which includes the command line interface and the main graph engine

The OpenTF Core repository is **not** currently accepting code contributions. We are still working on setting up the proper code contribution process, and we're doing our best to get this out of the way as quickly as possible!

However, you can already contribute by [opening an issue](https://github.com/opentffoundation/opentf/issues/new/choose)! Bug reports, broken compatibility reports, feature requests, old issue reposts, and well-prepared RFCs are all very welcome.

All major changes to OpenTF Core go through the public RFC process, including those proposed by the core team. Thus, if you'd like to propose such a change, please prepare an RFC, so that the community can discuss the change and everybody has a chance to voice their opinion. You're also welcome to voice your own opinion on existing RFCs!
