name: Provider issue (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)
about: Do you have a bug, feature request, or other issue with a provider (not Terraform core or the HCL language itself)?

Hi there,

Each provider has it's own repository, and issues should be opened there not on the main Terraform repository.

Here are some of the most common:

* [AWS](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws)
* [Azure](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azurerm)
* [Google](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws)

See the [terraform-providers](https://github.com/terraform-providers) GitHub organization for many others.
