## 0.2.0 (unreleased)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:

  * We've replaced the configuration language in use from a C library to
    a pure-Go reimplementation. In the process, we removed some features
    of the language since it was too flexible:
    * Semicolons are no longer valid at the end of lines
    * Keys cannot be double-quoted strings: `"foo" = "bar"` is no longer
      valid.
    * JSON style maps `{ "foo": "bar" }` are no longer valid outside of JSON.
      Maps must be in the format of `{ foo = "bar" }` (like other objects
      in the config)

FEATURES:

  * **New Function: `concat`**: Concatenate multiple strings together.
    Example: `concat(var.region, "-", var.channel)`.

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * core: "~/.terraformrc" (Unix) or "%APPDATA%/terraform.rc" (Windows)
    can be used to configure custom providers and provisioners. [GH-192]
  * providers/aws: EIPs now expose `allocation_id` and `public_ip`
      attributes.
  * providers/aws: Security group rules can be updated without a
      destroy/create.

BUG FIXES:

  * core: Variables are validated to not contain interpolations. [GH-180]
  * core: Key files for provisioning can now contain `~` and will be expanded
      to the user's home directory. [GH-179]
  * providers/aws: Fix issues around failing to read EIPs. [GH-122]
  * providers/aws: Autoscaling groups now register and export load
    balancers. [GH-207]
  * providers/heroku: If you delete the `config_vars` block, config vars
      are properly nuked.
  * providers/heroku: Domains and drains are deleted before the app.

PLUGIN CHANGES:

  * **New Package:** `helper/schema`. This introduces a high-level framework
    for easily writing new providers and resources. The Heroku provider has
    been converted to this as an example.
