## 0.2.0 (unreleased)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:

  * We've replaced the configuration language in use from a C library to
    a pure-Go reimplementation. In the process, we removed some features
    of the language since it was too flexible:
    * Semicolons are no longer valid at the end of lines
    * Keys cannot be double-quoted strings: `"foo" = "bar"` is no longer
      valid.

BUG FIXES:

  * core: Variables are validated to not contain interpolations. [GH-180]

PLUGIN CHANGES:

  * **New Package:** `helper/schema`. This introduces a high-level framework
    for easily writing new providers and resources. The Heroku provider has
    been converted to this as an example.
