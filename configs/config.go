// A Config is a node in the tree of modules within a configuration.

// The module tree is constructed by following ModuleCall instances recursively
// through the root module transitively into descendent modules.

// represented by configuration. During evaluation a static ModuleNode may
// expand into zero or more module instances depending on the use of count and
// for_each configuration attributes within each call.

	// this module. If this is the root module then this field is nil.
