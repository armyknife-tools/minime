# Provision

You're now able to create and modify infrastructure. This page
introduces how to use provisioners to run basic shell scripts on
instances when they're created.

If you're using an image-based infrastructure (perhaps with images
created with [Packer](http://www.packer.io)), then what you've
learned so far is good enough. But if you need to do some initial
setup on your instances, provisioners let you upload files,
run shell scripts, etc.
