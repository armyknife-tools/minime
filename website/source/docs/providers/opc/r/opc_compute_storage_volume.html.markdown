# opc\_compute\_storage\_volume

The ``opc_compute_storage_volume`` resource creates and manages a storage volume in an OPC identity domain.

~> **Caution:** The ``opc_compute_storage_volume`` resource can completely delete your storage volume just as easily as it can create it. To avoid costly accidents, consider setting [``prevent_destroy``](/docs/configuration/resources.html#prevent_destroy) on your storage volume resources as an extra safety measure.

## Example Usage

```
resource "opc_compute_storage_volume" "test" {
  name        = "storageVolume1"
  description = "Description for the Storage Volume"
  size        = 10
  tags        = ["bar", "foo"]
}
```

##Â Example Usage (Bootable Volume)
```
resource "opc_compute_image_list" "test" {
  name        = "imageList1"
  description = "Description for the Image List"
}

resource "opc_compute_storage_volume" "test" {
  name        = "storageVolume1"
  description = "Description for the Bootable Storage Volume"
  size        = 30
  tags        = ["first", "second"]
  bootable {
  	image_list = "${opc_compute_image_list.test.name}"
  }
}
```
