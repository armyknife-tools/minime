# Terraform Agent

The `terraform agent` command is the heart of Terraform: it runs the agent that
performs the important task of maintaining membership information,
running checks, announcing services, handling queries, etc.

Due to the power and flexibility of this command, the Terraform agent
is documented in its own section. See the [Terraform Agent](/docs/agent/basics.html)
section for more information on how to use this command and the
options it has.
