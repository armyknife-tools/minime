# Terraform Cloud Configuration

The main module of a Terraform configuration can integrate with Terraform Cloud to enable its [CLI-driven run workflow](/cloud-docs/run/cli). You only need to configure these settings when you want to use Terraform CLI to interact with Terraform Cloud. Terraform Cloud ignores them when interacting with
Terraform through version control or the API.

> **Hands On:** Try the [Migrate State to Terraform Cloud](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/cloud-migrate) tutorial on HashiCorp Learn.

## Usage Example

To configure the Terraform Cloud CLI integration, add a nested `cloud` block within the `terraform` block. Refer to [Using Terraform Cloud](/cli/cloud) in the Terraform CLI documentation for full configuration details, migration instructions, and command line arguments.

```hcl
terraform {
  cloud {
    organization = "example_corp"
    hostname = "app.terraform.io" # Optional; defaults to app.terraform.io

    workspaces {
      tags = ["app"]
    }
  }
}
```
