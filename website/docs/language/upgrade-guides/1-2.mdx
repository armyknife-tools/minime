# Upgrading to Terraform v1.2

Terraform v1.2 is a minor release in the stable Terraform v1.0 series.

Terraform v1.2 continues to honor
[the Terraform v1.0 Compatibility Promises](/language/v1-compatibility-promises),
but there are some behavior changes outside of those promises that may affect a
small number of users, described in the following sections.

* [Terraform requires Linux kernel 2.6.32 or later](#terraform-requires-linux-kernel-2-6-32-or-later)
* [Remote servers must support TLSv1.2](#remote-servers-must-support-tlsv1-2)
* [TLS Certificates signed with SHA-1 are no longer supported](#tls-certificates-signed-with-sha-1-are-no-longer-supported)
* [terraform-credentials-env functionality is now built into the Terraform CLI](#terraform-credentials-env-functionality-is-now-built-into-the-terraform-cli)

## Terraform requires Linux kernel 2.6.32 or later

The runtime which Terraform uses no longer supports Linux kernels prior to
2.6.32. With that in mind, the official releases of Terraform v1.2 for Linux
require distributions using kernel 2.6.32 or later. The CLI behavior on earlier
kernel versions is undefined.

## Remote servers must support TLSv1.2

When making outgoing HTTPS or other TLS connections as a client, Terraform now
requires the server to support TLS v1.2. TLS v1.0 and v1.1 are no longer
supported. Any safely up-to-date server should support TLS 1.2, and mainstream
web browsers have required it since 2020.

## TLS Certificates signed with SHA-1 are no longer supported

When making outgoing HTTPS or other TLS connections as a client, Terraform will
no longer accept CA certificates signed using the SHA-1 hash function. Publicly
trusted Certificate Authorities have not issued SHA-1 certificates since 2015.

## terraform-credentials-env functionality is now built into the Terraform CLI

If you use the [third-party credentials helper plugin terraform-credentials-env](https://github.com/apparentlymart/terraform-credentials-env),
you should disable it as part of upgrading to Terraform v1.2 because similar
functionality is now built in to Terraform itself.

The new behavior supports the same environment variable naming scheme but has a
difference in priority order from the credentials helper: `TF_TOKEN_...`
environment variables will now take priority over credentials blocks in CLI
configuration and credentials stored automatically by terraform login, which is
not true for credentials provided by any credentials helper plugin. If you see
Terraform using different credentials after upgrading, check to make sure you
do not specify credentials for the same host in multiple locations.

If you use the credentials helper in conjunction with the
[hashicorp/tfe](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe)
Terraform provider to manage Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise objects
with Terraform, you should also upgrade to version 0.31 of that provider, which
added the corresponding built-in support for these environment variables.
