# Upgrading to Terraform v1.2

Terraform v1.2 is a minor release in the stable Terraform v1.0 series.

Terraform v1.2 continues to honor the
[Terraform v1.0 Compatibility Promises](/language/v1-compatibility-promises),
but there are some behavior changes outside of those promises that may affect a
small number of users. Specifically, the following updates may require additional upgrade steps:

* [Terraform requires Linux kernel 2.6.32 or later](#terraform-requires-linux-kernel-2-6-32-or-later)
* [Remote servers must support TLSv1.2](#remote-servers-must-support-tlsv1-2)
* [TLS Certificates signed with SHA-1 are no longer supported](#tls-certificates-signed-with-sha-1-are-no-longer-supported)
* [terraform-credentials-env functionality is now built into the Terraform CLI](#terraform-credentials-env-functionality-is-now-built-into-the-terraform-cli)

## Terraform requires Linux kernel 2.6.32 or later

The runtime which Terraform uses no longer supports Linux kernels prior to
2.6.32. With that in mind, the official releases of Terraform v1.2 for Linux
require distributions using kernel 2.6.32 or later. The CLI behavior on earlier
kernel versions is undefined.

## Remote servers must support TLSv1.2

When making outgoing HTTPS or other TLS connections as a client, Terraform now
requires the server to support TLS v1.2. TLS v1.0 and v1.1 are no longer
supported. Any safely up-to-date server should support TLS 1.2, and mainstream
web browsers have required it since 2020.

## TLS Certificates signed with SHA-1 are no longer supported

Terraform will no longer accept CA certificates signed using the SHA-1 hash function when making outgoing HTTPS or other TLS connections as a client. Publicly-trusted Certificate Authorities have not issued SHA-1 certificates since 2015.

## terraform-credentials-env functionality is now built into the Terraform CLI

We recommend disabling the [third-party credentials helper plugin terraform-credentials-env](https://github.com/apparentlymart/terraform-credentials-env) when you upgrade to Terraform v1.2. Terraform now contains similar built-in functionality.

The new v1.2 functionality supports the same environment variable naming scheme as the credentials helper, but has a difference in priority order. Specifically, `TF_TOKEN_...` environment variables now take priority over both credentials blocks in CLI configuration and credentials stored automatically when you run `terraform login`. After upgrading, ensure you do not specify credentials for the same host in multiple locations.

We also recommend upgrading the [hashicorp/tfe](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe) provider to version 0.31 if you currently use it with the credentials helper to manage Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise objects. Version 0.31 contains built-in support for the built-in `TF_TOKEN_...` environment variables.
