# Import

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Import Terraform Configuration](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/state-import?in=terraform/state&utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS) tutorial.

Terraform can import existing infrastructure resources. This functionality allows you take resources you created by some other means and bring them under Terraform
management.

This method lets you slowly transition infrastructure to Terraform, or
to be able to be confident that you can use Terraform in the future if it
potentially doesn't support every feature you need today.

~> Warning: Terraform expects that each remote object it is managing will be
bound to only one resource address, which is normally guaranteed by Terraform
itself having created all objects. If you import existing objects into Terraform, be careful to import each remote object to only one Terraform resource address. If you import the same object multiple times, Terraform may exhibit unwanted behavior. Refer to [State](/language/state) for more details.

## State Only

Terraform import can only import resources into the [state](/language/state). It does not generate configuration.

Because of this, prior to running `terraform import` you must manually write a `resource` configuration block for the resource that describes where Terraform should map the imported object.

## Terraform Cloud

When you use Terraform on the command line with Terraform Cloud, many commands (e.g., `apply`) run inside your Terraform Cloud environment. However, the `import` command runs locally, so it does not have access to information from Terraform Cloud. To successfully perform an import, you may need to set local variables equivalent to any remote workspace variables in Terraform Cloud.
